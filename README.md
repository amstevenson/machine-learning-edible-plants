# Machine Learning Edible Plants

A machine learning model that determines if a plant is edible or not based on an image

# Plan of action followed to achieve this

## Getting the data together

1. Refer to 'List of edible stuff' - collect images
2. Refer to 'List of non edible stuff' collect images

## Creating the model

3. Create the dataframe with the following columns (route for creating model)
    - url (name of the image)
    - name (can be a plant, car, plane...etc)
    - edible (car = 0, edible plant = 1)
4. Create the model (refer to section)
5. Use hyper parameters; save mutliple weight files and compare and use best
6. Train the model against edible and non-edible images.

## Making predictions

7. Based on our prediction, if the plant is classified as edible, then show
that its an edible plant, along with the name. (route for predicting)
8. Based on the prediction, return whether it is edible or not.

## Extras

9. Add new images to DataSet if needed
